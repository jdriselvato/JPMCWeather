# JPMCWeatherApp
Weather app for JPM

The app supports:

- Search by zip code
- Search by country code and city name
- Search by GPS (lat/lon)
- It saves the last search location to User defaults
- Uses GPS location by default on boot
- Handles GPS permissions gracefully
- Support iPhone and iPad
- Supports light and dark mode

Additional notes:

- The app contains no CocoaPods Swift package manager SDKs; meaning all hand coded by me.
- The app contains unit tests including mock APIService testing.
- The app is natively programmed in UIKit + SwiftUI in the MVVM architecture.
